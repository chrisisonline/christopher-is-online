# ChristopherIsOnline.com [Personal Website]

Thanks to **Alexus Ouwendyk** for convincing me to get this done :D

#### The site was made using:
* kasper-html template
* sass (css)
* jquery
* wow animations (js)
* parallax.js 1.3 (js)
* simple-text-rotator (js)
* gulp.js
* node.js

##### Upcomming Plans!
* Try out a dark theme
* Re-design the project section
* Add more projects (possible seperate page for entire list)
* Cut out unneccesary assets & files to make the site more lightweight (reduce load times)
* Add a loading page
